Motivated by many examples of high-density systems composed of actively moving units, we set out to characterize the dynamics and phase space of such systems.

We found four distinct phases, characterized by dynamics/jamming and ordered/disordered motion.

The code in this repository implements molecular dynamics in two dimensions for overdamped, self-propelled particles using Euler integration and a combined Verlet list/cell list data structure for tracking neighbors. The code also computes physical quantities of interest: effective diffusion constants, velocity correlations, density fluctuations.
