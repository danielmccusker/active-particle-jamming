or to the paper that describes it, linked above, or ideally to both.

The code in this repository implements molecular dynamics in two dimensions for overdamped, self-propelled particles using Euler integration and a combined Verlet list/cell list algorithm for tracking neighbors. The code also computes physical quantities of interest: effective diffusion constants, velocity correlations, density fluctuations.
